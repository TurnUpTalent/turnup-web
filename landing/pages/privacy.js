                <p>Effective: January 02,2023</p>

                <p>TurnUp, (referred to in this policy as “TurnUP”
                    or “we” or “our”) is committed to maintaining the trust of our customers.
                    Please read this policy (the “Privacy Policy”) carefully to learn more about
                    TurnUp’s privacy practices and policies with respect to Customer Data (defined
                    below) that is collected through the data export interface (“The Admin Panel”),
                    and used through the TurnUp Internet application (the “Web App”). This Privacy
                    Policy applies to “Personal Data,” which is Customer Data that is associated
                    with an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal
                    data or personal information under applicable data protection law.</p>

                <p><b>1. TurnUp IS A SERVICE PROVIDER FOR ITS
                    CUSTOMERS</b></p>


                <p>TurnUp customers, and not TurnUp, determine how
                    and why Personal Data submitted to the TurnUp Service is used, either by or at
                    the direction of such customers. With respect to such Personal Data, (1) TurnUp
                    is a “service provider” under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”).
                    This Privacy Policy describes how TurnUp processes Personal Data as a Data
                    Processor for the purpose of providing the TurnUp Service to our customers
                    pursuant to the applicable data processing terms with those customers.</p>

                <p>As Data Controllers, TurnUp’s customers are
                    responsible for disclosing the rights of individuals (“Data Subjects”) with
                    respect to their Personal Data and other information regarding the collection
                    and use of that Personal Data, in accordance with CCPA, and other laws
                    requiring such disclosures.</p>

                <p><b>2. SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>

                <p>This Privacy Policy covers the processing of
                    Personal Data that TurnUp performs as a Data Processor for and on behalf of its
                    customers.</p>

                <p><b>3. PERSONAL DATA PROCESSED UNDER THIS
                    POLICY</b></p>

                <p>TurnUp acts as a Data Processor with respect to
                    any Personal Data comprised in the Customer Data. By “Customer Data” we mean
                    the content or information which individuals authorized by a customer submit to
                    the TurnUp Service.</p>

                <p><b>4. USE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</b></p>

                <p>TurnUp uses the Personal Data to provide the
                    TurnUp Service to our customers pursuant to the applicable data processing
                    terms with those customers. This will include integration of the TurnUp
                    Service.</p>

                <p><b>5. DISCLOSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA</b></p>

                <p>TurnUp does not disclose your Personal Data to
                    third parties except where permitted or requested by our applicable customer,
                    or where required by law.</p>

                <p><b>No Sale of Personal Data:</b>TurnUp does
                    not sell, rent or lease your Personal Data.</p>

                <p><b>Service Providers:</b>TurnUp may
                    disclose your Personal Data to our contracted service providers so that they
                    can provide TurnUp with services, such as IT, system administration and
                    hosting, and customer support.</p>

                <p>TurnUp will, to the extent required by law and
                    the applicable customer contract, obtain assurances before disclosing Personal
                    Data to a subcontractor or third-party agent that the recipient will: (a) use
                    the Personal Data only to assist TurnUp in providing, maintaining or improving
                    the TurnUp Service, (b) provide at least the same level of protection for
                    Personal Data as is required of TurnUp, and (c) notify TurnUp if the recipient
                    is no longer able to provide the required protections. Upon notice, TurnUp will
                    act promptly to endeavor to stop and remediate any unauthorized processing of
                    Personal Data by the recipient. TurnUp will remain liable for onward transfers
                    to its subcontractors and third-party agents.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p><b>6. SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</b></p>

                <p>As specified in the data processing terms with
the applicable Data Controller, TurnUp takes reasonable and appropriate
measures to protect your Personal Data from loss, misuse, and inappropriate
access.  We use standard, industry-wide best practices such as firewalls,
encryption of Customer Data at rest and in transit, and (in certain areas)
Secure Socket Layers (“SSL”) to protect your information.  However, as
effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable.
TurnUp cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee
that information that is supplied won't be intercepted while being transmitted
to TurnUp over the Internet.</p>

                <p><b>7. DATA RETENTION</b></p>

                <p>Storage periods depend on the data processing
terms with our customers and their choices, type of Personal Data, purposes of
its collection and processing, and applicable law.</p>

                <p><b>8. CHILDREN</b></p>

                <p>TurnUp does not direct the TurnUp Service and
associated websites to children. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from
children under the age of 16. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your
child has provided us with Personal Data without your consent, please contact
us at <a></a><a>privacy@turnup.com.</a>[1]<a></a>&nbsp;<a>[2]</a>&nbsp;
                </p>

above. TurnUp collects and receives this information for the business and
commercial purposes described in USE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA in Section 4 above.
TurnUp discloses this information as described in DISCLOSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA
in Section 5 above. TurnUp does not sell (as such term is defined in the CCPA)
the personal information we collect (and will not sell it without providing a
right to opt out).</p>

                <p>Subject to certain limitations, the CCPA
provides California consumers the right to request to know more details about
the categories or specific pieces of personal information we collect (including
how we use and disclose this information), to delete their personal
information, to opt out of any “sales” that may be occurring, and to not be
discriminated against for exercising these rights.</p>

pursuant to their rights under the CCPA by sending us an email at <a
                    href="mailto:privacy@turnup.com">privacy@turnup.com</a>.
                    <a>[5]</a>&nbsp;<a>[6]</a>&nbsp;
 We will verify your request and may request
government identification or other information in order to do so. Consumers can
also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on their behalf.</p>
